1. Simple Perceptron
******************************************************************

1. Briefly describe the design decisions that you have made in your implementation. (E.g, what programming language, how do you represent the vectors, etc.)
I used Python programming language, and datasets are represented using pandas library data frame object. The weights vector is stored as a Python list and bias as a float number. From the 5-fold cross-validation of 10 epochs, the hyperparameter that yields the best average cross-validation across all ten epochs is picked. The decided hyperparameter is used for online learning on the training dataset and tested on the dev dataset to get the best weights and bias. The best weight and bias are used to test the accuracy of the test dataset. I have used the same initial random weights and bias between -0.01 & 0.01 for cross-validation and online training. The dataset is shuffled using the random seed to produce consistent randomness.
